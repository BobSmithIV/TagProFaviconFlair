# TagProFaviconFlair

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BobSmithIV/TagProFaviconFlair/master/eg%20image.png)

This userscript will change the TagPro favicon (the wee icon in the tab) to your current flair.  

**Note:** you will have to change your flair once when you first install the script in order to initialize this userscript, after which it will remember which flair you currently use.  

To install this script:

On Chrome: Ensure you have [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) installed, then simply select the [userscript](https://github.com/BobSmithIV/TagProFaviconFlair/blob/master/TagPro%20Favicon%20Flair.user.js)  and click raw.  Tampermonkey should then automatically install the userscript for you.  

On Firefox: As above, but you should have [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-Us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) installed rather than Tampermonkey.
