# TagPro Favicon Flair

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BobSmithIV/TagProFaviconFlair/master/eg%20image.png)

This userscript will change the TagPro favicon (the wee icon in the tab) to your current flair.  

**Note:** you will have to change your flair once when you first install the script in order to initialize this userscript, after which it will remember which flair you currently use.  

**Compatability issues:**  This script is **not** compatabile with my [random flairs userscript](https://github.com/BobSmithIV/TagProRandomFlairs), however that userscript now includes the ability to change your favicon too, so if you wish to use both, simply install the random flairs userscript and select 'Change favicon' from the bottom of your profile page.  

To install this script:

On Chrome: Ensure you have [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) installed, then simply select the [userscript](https://github.com/BobSmithIV/TagProFaviconFlair/blob/master/TagPro%20Favicon%20Flair.user.js)  and click raw.  Tampermonkey should then automatically install the userscript for you.  

On Firefox: As above, but you should have [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-Us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) installed rather than Tampermonkey.
